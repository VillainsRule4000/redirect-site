# redirect-site
A very simple site that redirects you to another one!

## Why?
This is great for things like github.io sites, if you have a custom domain.<br>
This should also work with Glitch and Replit!

## Setup
To set this up for your site...
1. Fork this repository.
2. Open **YOUR-SITE.js**.
3. On line 1, change the **ADD-SITE-HERE** to the site to redirect to.

To make this your main github.io site, just fork this repository, and change the name to (your Github  username).github.io.
